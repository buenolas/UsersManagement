# User Management System

This project is a web-based user management system developed during the HCODE course. It utilizes HTML and CSS provided by HCODE and is implemented using JavaScript. The system incorporates various skills including the use of localStorage, JSON, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

- **User Management:** Allows users to be created, edited, and deleted.
- **localStorage:** Utilizes the browser's localStorage to store user data persistently.
- **JSON:** Uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data interchange between the application and localStorage.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implements OOP principles for better organization and modularity of the codebase.

## Usage

To use the user management system:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The main interface will allow you to create, edit, and delete users.
4. User data will be stored locally in the browser's localStorage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and layout for the web interface.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements to enhance the user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the functionality of the user management system.
- **localStorage:** Stores user data locally within the user's browser.
- **JSON:** Facilitates data interchange between the application and localStorage.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Organizes the codebase using OOP principles for better maintainability and scalability.

## Acknowledgements
